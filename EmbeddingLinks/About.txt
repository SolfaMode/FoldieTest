These files show how to embed Foldie links in other documents.

The Pages and Keynote documents show that you can embed links to sibling documents and self-reference the current document.

The Numbers and Excel documents show how you can construct Foldie Links which can then be opened with Foldie.

Limitations
=========

You can open the Foldie links in Pages, Numbers and Keynote both on Mac and iOS.
When you preview a Pages, Numbers or Keynote document within Foldie using the Eye button, the links within those documents may not be clickable.

Background:
- Quicklook previews on iPhone and iPad allow tapping links.
- Quicklook on Mac does not allow clicking links.

This is not a big problem, because you can have many apps and windows open on the Mac.
