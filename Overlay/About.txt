This example demonstrates the construction of folder overlays.
Note: it requires to activate the trial period or to buy the "Related Files" feature pack.

We construct TestOverlay as a virtual folder consisting of 4 base folders and one base file.
You can do this manually or press in Manage => Data => Generate Data => the "Create Overlay" button.

Step 1: Prepare 
============
Register the folders of this directory as base folders and change the name of the folder references such by prefixing "Test".
Normal -> TestNormal
Path -> TestPath
Mount -> TestMount
FolderTemplate -> TestFolderTemplate

Register the file BaseFile.txt as a base file and change its reference name as Test/BaseFile.txt.

Step 2: Construct
=============
Create a new virtual folder with name "TestOverlay".
Reference folder Normal in a simple way using TestNormal.
Reference the subfolder Path/Content by adding TestPath and setting Content as path.
Reference Mount/Mount.txt as TestOverlay/CommonFolder/Mount.txt by adding TestMount and setting CommonFolder as the mount path.
Reference FolderTemplate via TestFolderTemplate twice: at AppliedTemplate/Folder1 and at AppliedTemplate/Folder2.

Add BaseFile.txt as TestOverlay/CommonFolder/TestBaseFile.txt by choosing the Test/BaseFile.txt and setting CommonFolder/TestBaseFile.txt as mount path.

Step 3: Explore
============
Browse the TestOverlay and see how items from different folders are merged into the virtual folder.
Try different display styles (from the browser toolbar).
